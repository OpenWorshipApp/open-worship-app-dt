# OWA User Workflows — the tutorial source of truth

Canonical, **user-facing** task recipes for Open Worship App. Each workflow is written
in tutorial voice ("Click **X**, you should see **Y**") so it can be converted 1:1 into
a help page, and each is **traceable** (`Verify:` line) to
[coverage-matrix.md](../../../../docs/test-paths/coverage-matrix.md) row IDs so a robot run can prove every step
still matches the live app.

**Contract for this file:**

1. **Truth follows the live app**, not memory. If a robot run observes different
   behavior, either it's an app bug (→ file a Finding) or this file has drifted
   (→ update the workflow in the same run and note it in the report).
2. Workflow IDs (`W-01`…) are **stable** — tutorials, help pages, and doc-verification
   reports reference them. Add new workflows at the end; never renumber.
3. Every step names the control by its **English label** with the **Khmer label** in
   parentheses on first use (full map: [knowledge-base.md](./knowledge-base.md) §1).
   The app renders whichever locale the user chose.
4. `📸` marks a **screenshot checkpoint** — when generating a tutorial page, capture a
   fresh screenshot of the live app at exactly that state.
5. `Verify:` lists the coverage-matrix rows that prove the workflow. Verifying a
   tutorial or learning doc = running those rows.

**workflowsVersion: 2026-07-28** (bump when any workflow changes) — new **W-21**
(download a background video / audio from a link), observed live end-to-end. Previously:
W-16 Language now states that `Apply Settings` is required to complete the switch
(observed live).

> ⚠️ **Pending live re-verification (2026-07-18).** A `src/` sweep for the coverage-matrix
> expansion indicates the presenter UI has drifted from some steps below: **Foreground**
> (W-09) and **Bible text styling** (W-07) are now **floating widgets** (a toggle button)
> rather than middle-column split-tabs; presenting a slide is a **single-click toggle**
> (W-03/W-05 say double-click); Background **Web `+`** (W-08) opens a menu first; Settings
> **Theme** (W-16) offers **System / Light / Dark**. These are source-verified but **not
> yet confirmed on the live app**, so the tutorial prose is left as-is per this file's
> "truth follows the live app" contract — the next robot run must confirm each and correct
> the affected workflow (then bump `workflowsVersion`). The coverage-matrix REFINEs
> (`PM-01`, `PM-06`, `PM-13/14`, `PM-33`, `PM-57`, `ST` theme rows) already encode the
> observed behavior as test expectations.

## Orientation

### W-01 — Understand the Presenter window

**Goal:** know where everything lives.
**Where:** the main window (`presenter.html`), which opens on launch.

The Presenter has a header and three resizable columns:

- **Header:** page tabs — **Presenter** / **Bible Reader** (អានព្រះគម្ពីរ) /
  **Slide Editor** (កែសម្រួលស្លាយ) — the **Bible Lookup** (ស្វែងរកព្រះគម្ពីរ) button
  (center, `Ctrl+B`), and the **Settings** gear (ការកំណត់) + Help buttons (right). 📸
- **Left column:** your content libraries — **Documents** (ឯកសារ) and **Lyrics**
  (អក្សរភ្លេង) lists.
- **Middle column:** the working area — **Documents / Lyrics / Bibles / Foreground**
  preview tabs on top, and the collapsible **Background** panel at the bottom.
- **Right column:** **Bibles / Notes** lists and the **mini screen** — a live preview
  of exactly what the audience sees, with clear buttons and a zoom slider under it.

Drag any divider between panels to resize them; the size is remembered. 📸

*Verify: GL-12, NAV-01..02, PL-01, PR-04.*

### W-02 — Switch between the main pages

**Goal:** move between Presenter, Bible Reader, and Slide Editor.

1. Click a header tab — the window switches to that page in place.
2. **Slide Editor** only opens when a slide document is selected; otherwise the app
   shows an alert ("No slide selected") and stays put. Select a document in the left
   list first (W-03).

*Verify: NAV-01..04.*

---

## Presenting content

### W-03 — Present a slide from a document

**Goal:** put a slide on the screen.
**Preconditions:** at least one document in the **Documents** list.

1. In the left column, click a document in the **Documents** (ឯកសារ) list. It
   highlights, and its slides appear as thumbnails in the middle **Documents** tab. 📸
2. **Double-click** a slide thumbnail. The slide goes live: it appears on the mini
   screen, and the live item is marked highlighted (on-screen indicator). 📸
3. To step through slides with the keyboard, click once in the thumbnail area, then use
   **Arrow keys / PageUp / PageDown**; **Space** toggles the focused slide.
4. To remove the slide from the screen, press **F8** (Clear Slide — លុបស្លាយ) or click
   the matching clear button under the mini screen.

Tips:
- The slider in the Documents-tab footer resizes the thumbnails.
- The stopwatch icon in the same footer opens **auto-play**: set seconds, press play,
  and slides advance automatically; the red ✕ closes it (W-04).

*Verify: PL-01, PM-05..09, KB-05, KB-08.*

### W-04 — Auto-play slides on a timer

**Goal:** advance slides hands-free.

1. Open a document's slides (W-03 step 1).
2. Click the **stopwatch icon** in the Documents-tab footer — the auto-play widget
   expands. 📸
3. Type the interval in seconds, then click **play**. Slides advance on the timer.
4. Click **pause** to stop, or the red **✕** to close the widget.

*Verify: PM-10.*

### W-05 — Present song lyrics

**Goal:** put a song's lyrics on the screen.

1. In the left column, click a song in the **Lyrics** (អក្សរភ្លេង) list — the middle
   area switches to the **Lyrics** tab and shows its verses. 📸
2. **Double-click** a verse to send it to the screen.
3. Press **F8** / the clear button to take it down.

*Verify: PL-07..08, PM-11.*

### W-06 — Look up and present a Bible verse

**Goal:** find a verse fast and put it on screen.

1. Press **Ctrl+B** (or click **Bible Lookup** / ស្វែងរកព្រះគម្ពីរ in the header). The
   lookup opens as a popup dialog. 📸
2. The input is a **step-by-step picker**: type the first letters of the book (e.g.
   `Joh`) and click the book, then pick the chapter, then the verse. Press **Tab** to
   auto-complete the current part; **Escape** clears the input.
   > Note: typing a full reference like `John 3:16` in THIS dialog only filters the
   > book list — for full-reference typing use the **Bible Reader** page (W-10).
3. The verse renders in the preview panel. **Double-click** it to present. 📸
4. Close the dialog with the red ✕ button or **Ctrl+Q**.
5. Press **F9** (Clear Bible — លុបព្រះគម្ពីរ) to take the verse off screen.
6. The presented verse also appears in the **Bibles** tab (middle column) and the
   **Bibles** list (right column) for re-presenting later.

*Verify: NAV-06..07, RD-02, PM-12, PR-02, KB-01..02, KB-06, KB-09.*

### W-07 — Style the on-screen Bible text

**Goal:** change how verses look on the screen.

1. Open the middle **Bibles** (ព្រះគម្ពីរ) tab.
2. Open its settings split — the **Appearance** and **Text Shadow** cards. 📸
3. Adjust a control (size, color, shadow); the mini screen updates live.

*Verify: PM-13..14.*

### W-08 — Set the background (color / image / video / web)

**Goal:** put something behind your content.

1. At the bottom of the middle column, click the thin **Background** (ផ្ទៃខាងក្រោយ)
   bar — the panel expands to show its tabs. 📸
2. Pick a tab: **Colors / Images / Videos / Cameras / Web** (ពណ៌ / រូបភាព / វីដេអូ /
   កាមេរ៉ា / វេបសាយ).
   - **Colors:** click a swatch. If the color could clash with the text, the app asks
     whether to adjust the text color too — choose **Ok** or **Cancel**.
   - **Images / Videos:** **double-click** an item to make it the live background. 📸
   - **Cameras:** pick a connected camera device.
   - **Web:** click a saved page, or **+** to add one (opens the Web Editor, W-15).
3. The live background's tab shows a `*` prefix (e.g. `*Videos`).
4. Press **F7** (Clear Background) to remove it.

*Verify: PM-26..33, KB-04.*

### W-09 — Play audio, and foreground extras (countdown, clock, marquee bottom…)

**Goal:** run service extras.

**Audio:** in the Background panel, toggle the **Audios** (សំលេង) tab open, click play
on a track — the tab is marked while playing; click stop to end. 📸

**Foreground widgets** — open the middle **Foreground** (ផ្ទៃខាងមុខ) tab; each widget
has its own controls and a Show/Start button:

- **Marquee Top:** type the scrolling text, click Show — it scrolls along the top edge.
- **Marquee Bottom:** type the scrolling text, click Show — it scrolls along the bottom
  edge. Top and bottom can be shown at the same time.
- Both marquees expose a **scroll speed** (%) under *Properties*: `100%` is the default
  pace, higher is faster, lower is slower. Changing it while a marquee is showing
  re-paces it without having to click Show again.
- **Quick Text:** type a short message, click Show.
- **Countdown:** two modes — *to a date/time* (set date + time, press Start) or *for a
  duration* (set hours/minutes, press Start). Hide with its Hide button. 📸
- **Stopwatch**, **Clock**, **Images slideshow**, **Camera overlay**, **Web overlay**:
  same pattern — configure, Show, Hide.
- The shared properties row (font size / color / position) restyles the live widget.
- Power move: **drag** a widget's Show button and **drop it on the mini screen** to
  start it there; **right-click** the button to choose a specific display.

Press **F10** (Clear Foreground) to clear all foreground widgets, or **F6** to clear
everything at once.

*Verify: PM-15..25, PM-28, PM-34, KB-03, KB-07.*

### W-10 — Control what the audience sees (mini screen + clears)

**Goal:** manage the live output from the screen preview card.

- The **mini screen** (right column, bottom) always mirrors the audience view; the
  zoom slider under it only rescales your preview, not the output. 📸
- Each screen has its own preview card with a **header** and **footer** of controls:
- **Show / hide the screen** (header, leftmost — or press **F5**): turns the physical
  output display on or off. The icon fills in and brightens while showing. 📸
- **Clear buttons** (header — each also has a function key):
  **Clear All `F6` / BG `F7` / SL `F8` / BB `F9` / FG `F10`**
  (លុបទាំងអស់ / លុបផ្ទៃខាងក្រោយ / លុបស្លាយ / លុបព្រះគម្ពីរ / លុបផ្ទៃខាងមុខ).
  A button is only lit while its layer has something to clear.
- **Lock** (header, the padlock): when locked (red), the screen refuses slide changes —
  handy during a live moment; click again (green) to unlock.
- **Display** (footer, e.g. `(0):2678…`): click to pick **which physical display** this
  screen projects to — the menu lists every display with its resolution, and marks the
  current one with `*` and the primary one with `(primary)`.
- **Transitions** (footer, `Tr:`): the **Slide:** and **Background:** buttons choose the
  change animation — **none / fade / move / zoom**. 📸
- **Background audio** (footer, the soundwave icon — appears while a video background
  is live): opens a small player per video to play/pause its audio in sync; the
  repeat icon loops it. The app refuses to close the player while audio is playing.
- **Stage number** (footer, `St:`): click to assign this screen a stage number
  (0–4, or increment/decrement) for stage-view setups.

## Bible study

### W-11 — Read the Bible (full references, versions)

**Goal:** deeper reading than the quick lookup.
**Where:** header tab **Bible Reader** (អានព្រះគម្ពីរ).

1. Click the **Bible Reader** tab. 📸
2. Type a reference — here a **full reference** like `John 3:16` resolves straight to
   the verse. The picker keys still work (**Tab** complete, **Escape** clear,
   **Ctrl+Escape** clear one part).
3. Switch the Bible **version** from the header dropdown — the text re-renders. 📸
4. Recent lookups appear as **history** entries; click one to jump back.
5. Double-click a verse to present it.

*Verify: RD-01..07, RD-11.*

### W-12 — Search the whole Bible (Bible Find)

**Goal:** find verses by words, not reference.

1. In the Bible Reader (or the lookup dialog), open the **advanced lookup** toggle —
   a second panel ("Bible Online Lookup") appears beside the picker. 📸
2. Type your search words. Matching verses list page by page; click the **page
   numbers** to browse. 📸
3. Click a result to open that verse.

*Verify: RD-08..09.*

### W-13 — Cross references

**Goal:** see related verses.

1. With a verse open, open its **cross references** view — related passages are
   listed; click one to read it. 📸
2. AI-generated cross references require an API key configured in Settings; without
   one, only the built-in references appear.

*Verify: RD-10.*

### W-14 — Keep Bible notes

**Goal:** attach your own notes to study.

1. In the right column (Presenter) or the Reader, switch to the **Notes**
   (កំណត់ត្រាព្រះគម្ពីរ) sub-tab.
2. Open a note for editing — the **Bible Note** editor opens in its own window. 📸
3. Type your note and save (**Ctrl+S**).

*Verify: PR-03, PU-03, KB-11.*

---

## Creating & editing content

### W-15 — Create and edit slides / lyrics / web backgrounds

**Slides** (Slide Editor — កែសម្រួលស្លាយ):

1. Select a slide document, then click the **Slide Editor** header tab. 📸
2. Left: the slide list — click to select; right-click to **add / duplicate / delete**;
   drag to reorder.
3. Canvas: click a box to select it; drag to move; drag the handles to resize;
   **double-click a text box** to type into it; **Ctrl+Enter** focuses the canvas. 📸
   (From the **Presenter**, right-click a slide → **Edit ↗** opens this editor in its
   own window, focused on that slide.)
4. Add new boxes/images from the tools panel (click, or drag onto the canvas).
5. Save with **Ctrl+S**.

**Lyrics:** right-click a song in the Lyrics list → **edit** — the Lyric Editor opens
in its own window; edit the text/chords and save with **Ctrl+S**. 📸

**Web backgrounds:** Background panel → **Web** tab → **+** — the Web Editor opens;
enter the URL and title, save, and the new item appears in the Web tab.

*Verify: ED-01..11, PU-02, PU-04, PL-09, PM-33.*

## Configuration

### W-16 — Settings: language, theme, fonts, folders

**Goal:** configure the app.

1. Click the **gear** (ការកំណត់) in the header — Settings opens in its own window. 📸
2. **General** tab:
   - **Language:** click **Khmer** (ភាសាខ្មែរ) or **English** (ភាសាអង់គ្លេស). Some
     labels change straight away, but the switch is only complete once you click
     **Apply Settings** (អនុវត្តការកំណត់) at the bottom-left — that reloads every open
     window. Unsaved edits in the Slide Editor are kept.
   - **Theme:** system / light / dark.
   - **Font family:** the font used for on-screen text. A font marked `(Missing)` is
     configured but not installed on this computer.
   - **Directories:** where documents, lyrics, and bibles are stored on disk.
   - **Reset buttons** (`Reset All Child Directories` / `Reset Widgets Size` /
     `Clear All Settings`): each asks for confirmation first — **these erase
     configuration; use with care.**
3. **Bible** tab: search available Bible versions, download new ones, enable/disable
   downloaded ones. 📸
4. Click **Apply Settings** (top-right) to apply — the app windows reload.

*Verify: ST-01..09, LT-02..04.*

### W-17 — Find text anywhere (Finder) & About

- **Finder:** opens in its own small window — type a query, jump between matches with
  the prev/next arrows or **Enter**; toggle case-sensitivity with its checkbox. 📸
- **About:** shows the app version and project links.

*Verify: PU-01, PU-05.*

### W-18 — Use more than one screen (multi-screen)

**Goal:** project different (or the same) content to several displays.

1. **Right-click** an empty area of the mini-screen panel and choose **Add New
   Screen** — a second preview card appears with its own number and color. 📸
2. Each card targets its own physical display (W-10, the Display button) and has its
   own show/hide, clears, transitions, and lock.
3. Content goes to every **selected** screen. Right-click a card to **Select /
   Deselect** it, or **Solo** to make it the only selected one.
4. You can also **drag** a slide, background item, or foreground Show button and
   **drop it on one specific card** to present it on that screen only. 📸
5. While a Bible verse is live, the card's right-click menu offers **Set Line Sync**
   to keep verse highlighting in sync across screens.
6. Right-click a card → **Delete** removes a screen you no longer need (the first
   screen can't be deleted while it is the only one).

*Verify: SP-04..05, SP-10..12.*

### W-19 — Draw and spotlight on the app itself (Presenting Control)

**Goal:** annotate **the app window** — not the audience screen — while showing the app
to other people (a training session, a screen share, a projector mirroring your laptop).
The audience screen has its own Draw and Focus tools on the mini-screen card (W-10);
this is the same pair of tools pointed at the app.

1. Open the **Tools** menu → **Start Controlling** (**Ctrl+Shift+P**, **⌘+Shift+P** on
   Mac). A floating **Presenting Control** panel appears — drag it by its title bar,
   resize it from any edge or corner, and collapse it with the chevron; it reopens where
   and how you last left it. 📸
2. The **title bar** carries everything you reach for mid-presentation: the four tools on
   the left, then the **keyboard screencast** switch (W-20) and **Undo** / **Redo** /
   **Clear** on the right. Only the settings live in the body, so collapsing the panel
   with the chevron leaves every group one click away — roll it up to get the sliders out
   of the way and keep drawing.
3. The panel opens on the **arrow** tool — the app stays completely usable and
   anything already drawn stays visible on top of it.
4. Click the **brush** to draw. A magenta frame around the window shows the app is no
   longer taking clicks; drag anywhere to draw. Pick **Color**, **Size** (`[` / `]`) and
   **Opacity** (`-` / `=`), and switch the stroke style with **Straight** (`S`), **3D**
   (`3`) or **Dots** (`D`). **HQ** (`Q`) trades smoothness for speed on weak machines. 📸
5. Click the **eraser** to rub parts of the drawing out, and use the title bar's
   **Undo** / **Redo** (`Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Shift+Z`) to step back or the red **Clear** (`C`)
   to wipe it — one Undo brings a mis-hit Clear back. All three grey out when there is
   nothing to undo, redo or clear, and all three keys work from **any** tool and with the
   panel **collapsed**, matching the buttons they mirror.
6. Click the **spotlight** to dim the whole app except a circle. In **Follow** (the
   default) the circle simply tracks your pointer; press **Hold** (`H`) if you would
   rather dim only while the mouse button is down. **Contrast** (`X`) inverts it — the
   circle becomes the blocked area instead. Size, **Dim color**, dim amount and **edge
   blur** (`,` / `.`) all have sliders. 📸
7. Press **Escape** (or click the arrow) to hand the app back while keeping the
   drawing on screen. Move the panel if it covers what you are pointing at.
8. Click **✕** in the panel header to finish. The drawing is discarded; it is not saved
   between sessions. **Ctrl+Shift+P** and **Tools → Start Controlling** only ever *open*
   the panel — neither closes it, so a stray press mid-service cannot lose your drawing.

> Note: the panel owns the keyboard only while a tool is **armed** — the same moment it
> owns the pointer. On the **arrow** tool the app keeps every key it normally has (the
> Bible Lookup's Enter and Escape, `F5`–`F10`, `Ctrl+B`, `Ctrl+Z`, slide navigation)
> while `V` `B` `E` `F` `K` still reach in to pick a tool; whatever holds the keyboard
> still wins, as the tool letters defer while you are typing in a field and while a
> screen preview's own draw/spotlight overlay is focused. Arm a tool and the picture
> flips: the overlay covers the **whole** window and the app takes **nothing** — not a
> click, not a key. Every keystroke is swallowed before the app sees it, down to the
> plain ones nothing is bound to: typing goes nowhere, `Space` and the arrows stop
> scrolling, `Tab` stops walking the focus ring, and a dialog behind the overlay stays
> deaf. Only the panel's own keys stay live (`V` `B` `E` `F`, `Escape`, `Ctrl+Z` /
> `Ctrl+Shift+Z` / `C`, which now act on the **drawing**), along with anything typed into
> the panel's own sliders and color box. Escape or the arrow tool hands everything
> straight back. The Undo / Redo / Clear **buttons** work in every tool regardless.

*Verify: coverage rows pending — the matrix lives at `docs/test-paths/coverage-matrix.md`
but has no `PC-xx` (presenting-control) block yet; add one for this workflow.*

### W-20 — Show the keys you press (Keyboard Screencast)

**Goal:** let the room see **which keys you are pressing** while you demonstrate the app —
a training session, a screen share, a recorded tutorial. It is the keyboard counterpart to
the drawing in W-19, and it lives in the same panel.

1. Open the **Presenting Control** panel (W-19 step 1: **Tools → Start Controlling**,
   **Ctrl+Shift+P**).
2. In the panel's title bar, click the **keyboard** button (`K`) — it sits between the
   four tools and Undo / Redo / Clear, and lights up while it is on. Nothing appears on
   screen yet; the strip only shows up once you press something.
3. Press any key. A dark strip of key pills appears **across the bottom** of the window,
   above everything else — including your own drawing and the spotlight. 📸
4. The strip keeps the **last six** keys. Pressing the same key over and over collapses
   into one pill with a **×N** counter (`→ ×2`), so a run of arrow presses does not push
   the rest of the strip away. Holding a key down counts as one press.
5. Chords are shown the way the app names them: **Ctrl+Z**, **Esc**, **Space**,
   **↑ ↓ ← →**. Plain typing shows the character you actually typed; a shortcut is shown
   on the en-US key the app binds it to, whatever your layout produces.
6. The strip **clears itself** about a second and a half after your last key, so it is
   never in the way between one demonstration and the next.
7. Click the keyboard button again (or press `K`) to turn it off. **Closing the panel
   turns it off too** — the screencast belongs to the panel, and reopening starts with it
   off again.
8. Picking the **brush**, **eraser** or **spotlight** turns it off as well, and greys the
   keyboard button out until you go back to the **arrow** — an armed tool swallows the
   keyboard (W-19), so there would be nothing left to echo. Turn it back on with `K` or
   the button once the arrow tool is back.

> Notes: the screencast belongs to the **arrow** tool — it narrates the app being driven,
> not a drawing being made. It never takes clicks and never blocks a key: it only
> **echoes** what you pressed. What you type into a **password** field is masked as `•`.

*Verify: coverage rows pending — same `PC-xx` block as W-19 when the matrix lands.*

### W-21 — Add a background video or song from a link

**Goal:** get a video (or its audio as an MP3) from an online link straight into your
Videos / Audios folder, without leaving the app or installing anything.

1. Open the **Background** (ផ្ទៃខាងក្រោយ) panel (W-08 step 1) and choose the **Videos**
   (វីដេអូ) tab — or the **♫Audios♫** (សំលេង) split if you want the sound only.
2. **Right-click an empty part of the list** (or use the **+** button in the folder-path
   bar) and choose **Download From URL** (ទាញយកពី URL). 📸
3. A small box asks for the link — **Video URL:** on the Videos tab, **Audio URL:** on
   Audios. If you copied the link first, it is **already filled in**; otherwise paste it.
   The box is outlined red while it is empty.
4. Click **Ok**. The download runs in the background — a full song or video takes a
   couple of minutes, and you can keep using the app while it does.
5. When it finishes, the file **appears in the folder you were in**: the video shows up as
   a new thumbnail in the Videos tab, the audio as a new row under ♫Audios♫. 📸 From there
   it behaves like any other background (W-08) or track (W-09).

> Notes: audio is always converted to **MP3**, video keeps the site's best quality
> (`.webm`/`.mp4`). If a file with that name is already in the folder, the new one is
> saved as `name (1)`. Pasting something that is not a web link gets you an **Invalid
> URL** message and nothing is downloaded. Downloads need an internet connection — and
> a busy site can cut a large download off partway, in which case just try again.
