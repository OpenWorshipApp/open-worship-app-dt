## Info

### FYI

- KJV: Psalm 150:6
  => Let every thing that hath breath Praise the LORD. Praise ye the LORD.
- I want to see an application very powerful, easy to use and free for everyone to do presentation during worship service.
- Thanks God for everything. I'm Raksa, the first creator and working alone on this project. But I'm alone cannot make this app possible for using for worship. May God bless this project through you.
- This app will be free forever and absolutely open-source.
- This is not ready to use yet, but I need many help.
- If you have any question or idea please share in [Issues](https://github.com/OpenWorshipApp/open-worship-app-dt/issues), or contact me at <eng.raksa@gmail.com> if you need more information
- 🙏🏻May God bless you🙏🏻
